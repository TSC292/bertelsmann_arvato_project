# Bertelsmann Arvato Capstone Project
## Summary
This is a project to practice the use of clustering, customer profiling and predictive modelling. The datasets reveal demographics information on the German population and on the customer base of a large mail-order company. The goals are to apply clustering to segment customers, view how customers fit into the general population and see the extent to which marketing success can be improved through clustering and predictive modelling. The data is restricted and had to be deleted soon after the project ended so can't be included.

## Problem Statement
The first goal is to segment customers, identifying which demographic attributes describe them best, and understand how the customers are distributed amongst segments of the German population.
The strategy for the first problem is to segment the customers through unsupervised learning, clustering techniques, before examining the resulting clusters to build customer profiles. Furthermore, the population will be segmented using the same clustering technique and the distribution of customers across these segments will be reviewed.
The second goal is to use demographic attributes data and predictive modelling to attempt to improve the acquisition rate from marketing campaigns by delivering precise forecasts . The strategy is to prepare training data for a binary classification predictive model before training a random forest ensemble classification model on the data and validating results. There is a particular interest in seeing if the clusters created through the unsupervised learning technique help with model performance.
Metrics - in the case of the predictive model, precision is being used as a measure of success. This is justifiable because it is comparable to the key measure of success in pre-existing customer acquisition process of mass mail-out marketing.
